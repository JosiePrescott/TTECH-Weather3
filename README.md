Added the API for the weather, it will now update for the day and 5-day forecast. It grabs from the API given on the webpage and inserts it into my code, replacing the placeholders I had there before.
Everything is for Salt Lake, not Tooele. 
The 5-day forecast will show today and then the next 5-days.
The images also correlate with the forecast and have 5 different icons they can be.
I had to change the image path in GitHub, but that is now working.
I also added a footer that will record when I change information on a day month year level.
This is the link to my working webpage: https://josieprescott.github.io/TTECH-Weather3/weather.html
